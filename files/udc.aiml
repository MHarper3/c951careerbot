          Good question! Picking a career after graduating can be a daunting
          task.  I will ask you a few questions to determine what might be a
          good fit for you. First question: Would you prefer a job that consists
          of mostly programming on a day to day basis?

              Got it! Sounds like you'd be a good fit for a data scientist role.
              <br/><br/>
              According to Coursera,
              "Data scientists determine the questions their team should be 
              asking and figure out how to answer those questions using data. 
              They often develop predictive models for theorizing and forecasting."

              Got it! Sounds like you'd be a good fit for a game developer role.
              <br/><br/>
              According to Coursera, 
              "Video game developers help transform games from a concept to a playable 
              reality. They do this by coding visual elements, programming features, 
              and testing iterations until a game is ready for market. If you love 
              video games and enjoy working with computers, a career in video game 
              development can be immensely rewarding."

              Just one more question!  Do you prefer 1) keeping existing networks
              and systems secure or 2) designing, installing, and maintaining 
              networks?

              According to Coursera,
              "A cloud engineer is an IT professional that builds and maintains

              Got it! Sounds like you'd be a good fit for an information security
              analyst role.
              <br/><br/>
              According to Coursera, 
              "The twenty-first century has already seen large information breaches 
              at big companies in which sensitive data—including the credit card numbers, 
              passwords, and social security numbers of hundreds of millions of users—were 
              compromised. Information security analysts work to protect organizations 
              from similar threats, preventing data hacks and breaches."

              According to Coursera, 
              "A network administrator is an IT professional who ensures that an 
              organization’s computer networks—groups of computers that share 
              information with one another—are operating to meet the needs of the 
              organization. They can maintain and troubleshoot computer networks, 
              and employ security principles to keep networks secure."
